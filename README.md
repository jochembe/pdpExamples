# pdpExamples
This repository contains all example data for the proof of concept of enhanced Product Data Provision using IFC and Linked Data, respectively. The examples are based on a BIM object of a partitioning wall assembly, as found in the public database [dataholz.eu](https://www.dataholz.eu/bauteile/trennwand/variante/kz/twmxxo02a/nr/01.htm). Product data of a [suiting product](https://www.dataholz.eu/securedl/sdl-eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpYXQiOjE3MTMxODU1NjgsImV4cCI6MTcxMzI3NTU2OCwidXNlciI6MCwiZ3JvdXBzIjpbMCwtMV0sImZpbGUiOiJmaWxlYWRtaW4vZGF0YWhvbHovbWVkaWEvYmF1c3RvZmZlL2V0YS9lbl9ldGFfMjAtMDg2MF9oYnNfYnNwX2VuLnBkZiIsInBhZ2UiOjcyOX0.irVLbJ0dUG5tth-saP6RoSQOIjAGj88ju65f9VD1Zss/en_eta_20-0860_hbs_bsp_en.pdf) listed in the same database was associated to the core layer of the wall model using two different approaches: enriching the existing IFC file and using Linked Building Product Data.

## Use Case
contains a Use Case description following the building smart UCM framework.

## IFC
contains the IFC file of the modeled wall, enriched with product data.

## Linked Building Product Data
containes a representation of the product data in triple-store format, as well as a representation of the wall assembly with product data associated to the core layer.
